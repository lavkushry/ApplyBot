## Mission

To democratize the job search process by providing every job seeker with the tools, insights, and support typically available only to those with extensive professional networks or expensive career coaches.

### 1. Empowerment Over Replacement
ApplyPilot doesn't replace human judgment—it enhances it. We provide recommendations and automation, but you remain in control of all decisions.

### 2. Truthfulness Above All
We never fabricate experience, skills, or qualifications. Our recommendations are based solely on your actual background and achievements.

### 3. Privacy First
Your job search data is sensitive. We treat it with the highest level of security and never share it without explicit consent.

### 4. Continuous Learning
ApplyPilot learns from outcomes to improve recommendations over time. Every application, interview, and offer contributes to better future guidance.

### 5. Accessibility
Job search tools should be available to everyone, regardless of technical expertise or financial resources.

- Misrepresent your experience or skills
- Spam companies with applications
- Use deceptive practices to game ATS systems
- Share your data with third parties

## Learning Loop

ApplyPilot improves through a continuous feedback loop:

```
